# Bank Management System in Python

Welcome to the **Bank Management System** repository! This project is a simple ATM-like banking management system implemented in Python. It allows users to perform basic banking operations like checking balances, withdrawing and depositing cash, and viewing transaction history.

---

## Features

1. **Balance Inquiry:** View the current account balance instantly.
2. **Cash Withdrawal:** Withdraw a specified amount from your account, ensuring that the balance does not go negative.
3. **Cash Deposit:** Deposit a specified amount to your account, increasing the balance.
4. **Transaction History:** View a detailed history of all transactions (withdrawals and deposits).
5. **Secure Exit:** Exit the program after confirmation.

---

## How It Works

1. **Authentication:**
   - Username: `abc`
   - Password: `123`
   - Both are hardcoded for demonstration purposes.

2. **Menu Options:**
   - Users can choose from the following options:
     - `1`: Check balance
     - `2`: Withdraw cash
     - `3`: Deposit cash
     - `4`: View transaction history
     - `5`: Exit the program

3. **Transaction Storage:**
   - All transactions (withdrawals and deposits) are stored in a list called `transaction_history` during the runtime of the application.

## Example Usage

Here's how the interaction with the program might look:

```
Welcome to the ATM!
Enter your username (Demo user: abc): abc
Enter your password (Demo password: 123): 123

1. Balance Inquiry
2. Withdraw Cash
3. Deposit Cash
4. View Transaction History
5. Exit
Please enter your choice (1-5): 1
Your current balance is 10000
```

---

## Limitations

- The username and password are hardcoded for demonstration purposes.
- Transactions are stored in memory and are not persistent (lost after the program is terminated).
- The program is designed as a prototype and does not support advanced features like user account management or error logging.
